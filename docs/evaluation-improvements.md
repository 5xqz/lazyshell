# Evaluation System Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive improvements to the evaluation system, providing enhanced capabilities for testing and validating AI-generated commands with better insights, reliability, and flexibility.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Data Structures

#### Test Data with Metadata
```typescript
interface TestData<TInput = any, TExpected = any> {
  input: TInput;
  expected: TExpected;
  metadata?: {
    category?: string;           // Group tests by functionality
    difficulty?: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
    tags?: string[];            // Flexible tagging system
    description?: string;       // Human-readable description
    weight?: number;           // For weighted scoring
  };
}
```

#### Enhanced Scorer Results
```typescript
interface ScorerResult {
  score: number;              // 0-1 normalized score
  reasoning?: string;         // Explanation of the score
  confidence?: number;        // Confidence level (0-1)
  metadata?: Record<string, any>; // Additional scorer-specific data
}
```

### 2. Advanced Scoring System

#### Weighted Scoring
- Assign different weights to scorers based on importance
- Security scorers can have higher weights than efficiency scorers
- Calculate both regular and weighted averages

#### Category-Based Analysis
- Group scorers by categories (accuracy, security, performance, usability)
- Analyze performance across different aspects
- Identify strengths and weaknesses by category

#### Statistical Analysis
- Min, max, median, and standard deviation for each scorer
- Better understanding of score distribution and consistency
- Identify outliers and edge cases

### 3. Enhanced Scorers

#### Built-in Scorers

**EnhancedExactMatch**
- Provides confidence scores and detailed reasoning
- Categorized under 'accuracy'

**FuzzyMatch**
- Configurable similarity threshold
- Uses Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
- Returns similarity percentage and confidence

**CommandSafety**
- Specialized scorer for command safety evaluation
- Detects dangerous patterns (rm -rf /, dd, mkfs, etc.)
- High weight for security-critical applications

#### Enhanced LLM Judge
```typescript
createEnhancedLLMJudge(
  name: string,
  criteria: string,
  modelConfig?: ModelConfig,
  options: {
    temperature?: number;      // Control randomness
    maxRetries?: number;       // Retry failed evaluations
    delayMs?: number;         // Rate limiting
    includeExamples?: boolean; // Include scoring examples
    weight?: number;          // Scorer weight
    category?: string;        // Scorer category
  }
)
```

**Improvements:**
- Better prompting with examples
- Confidence scoring
- Suggestions for improvement
- Configurable temperature and retries
- Enhanced error handling

### 4. Execution Options

#### Parallel Processing
```typescript
options: {
  parallel: true,           // Run scorers in parallel
  maxConcurrency: 3,       // Limit concurrent operations
}
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
options: {
  continueOnError: true,   // Continue even if some tests fail
  timeout: 30000,          // Timeout for individual tests
  retries: 2,              // Retry failed operations
}
```

#### Result Management
```typescript
options: {
  saveResults: true,       // Automatically save results
  outputDir: './eval-results', // Custom output directory
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Analytics

#### Performance by Category
```
📂 Performance by Category:
  accuracy: 85.2% ✅
  security: 92.1% ✅
  performance: 78.5% ✅
  usability: 81.3% ✅
```

#### Performance by Difficulty
```
🎯 Performance by Difficulty:
  easy: 94.2% ✅
  medium: 78.1% ✅
  hard: 65.4% ⚠️
```

#### Statistical Summary
```
📈 Average scores:
  ExactMatch: 0.750 (min: 0.000, max: 1.000, σ: 0.433)
  FuzzyMatch: 0.823 (min: 0.200, max: 1.000, σ: 0.312)
  CommandSafety: 0.917 (min: 0.500, max: 1.000, σ: 0.204)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Evaluation

```typescript
import { eval as runEnhancedEval, EnhancedExactMatch, CommandSafety } from './eval-improvements';

const results = await runEnhancedEval('My Evaluation', {
  data: async () => [
    {
      input: 'list files',
      expected: 'ls',
      metadata: {
        category: 'file-operations',
        difficulty: 'easy',
        weight: 1.0
      }
    }
  ],
  task: async (input) => generateCommand(input),
  scorers: [EnhancedExactMatch, CommandSafety],
  options: {
    saveResults: true,
    parallel: false,
    timeout: 30000
  }
});
```

### Advanced LLM Judge Configuration

```typescript
const advancedJudge = createEnhancedLLMJudge(
  'SecurityExpert',
  'security implications, potential risks, and safety best practices',
  judgeModelConfig,
  {
    weight: 2.0,              // High importance
    category: 'security',     // Security category
    includeExamples: true,    // Include scoring examples
    temperature: 0.05,        // Low temperature for consistency
    maxRetries: 3,           // Retry on failures
    delayMs: 1000            // Rate limiting
  }
);
```

### Custom Scorer Implementation

```typescript
const CustomScorer: EnhancedScorer<string, string, string> = {
  name: 'CustomLogic',
  description: 'Custom business logic validation',
  category: 'business',
  weight: 1.5,
  score: (input, output, expected): ScorerResult => {
    // Custom scoring logic
    const score = customValidation(input, output, expected);
    return {
      score,
      confidence: 0.9,
      reasoning: 'Custom validation passed',
      metadata: { customData: true }
    };
  }
};
```

## Migration Guide

### From Basic to Enhanced Evaluation

1. **Update Imports**
```typescript
// Old
import { eval, ExactMatch, LLMJudge } from './eval';

// New
import { 
  eval as runEnhancedEval, 
  EnhancedExactMatch, 
  createEnhancedLLMJudge 
} from './eval-improvements';
```

2. **Enhance Test Data**
```typescript
// Old
{ input: 'test', expected: 'result' }

// New
{ 
  input: 'test', 
  expected: 'result',
  metadata: {
    category: 'testing',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    weight: 1.0
  }
}
```

3. **Update Scorers**
```typescript
// Old
scorers: [ExactMatch, LLMJudge]

// New
scorers: [
  EnhancedExactMatch,
  createEnhancedLLMJudge('Quality', 'overall quality', modelConfig, {
    weight: 1.5,
    category: 'quality'
  })
]
```

4. **Add Options**
```typescript
// New
options: {
  saveResults: true,
  continueOnError: true,
  timeout: 30000
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Scorer Selection and Weighting

- **Security-critical applications**: Use high weights for safety scorers
- **Performance-critical applications**: Emphasize efficiency scorers
- **User-facing applications**: Balance usability and correctness

### 2. Test Data Organization

- **Categorize tests** by functionality (file-ops, network, system, etc.)
- **Set appropriate difficulty levels** to understand model capabilities
- **Use descriptive tags** for better filtering and analysis

### 3. LLM Judge Configuration

- **Use low temperature** (0.05-0.1) for consistent scoring
- **Include examples** for better prompt understanding
- **Set appropriate retries** for reliability
- **Configure rate limiting** to avoid API limits

### 4. Error Handling

- **Enable continueOnError** for comprehensive evaluation
- **Set reasonable timeouts** based on task complexity
- **Configure retries** for transient failures

### 5. Result Analysis

- **Review category performance** to identify systematic issues
- **Analyze difficulty trends** to understand model limitations
- **Examine failed tests** for improvement opportunities
- **Compare weighted vs unweighted scores** for balanced assessment

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- LLM judges can hit API rate limits
- Use delays and retries appropriately
- Consider parallel execution carefully

### Memory Usage
- Large evaluations can consume significant memory
- Consider batch processing for very large test suites
- Save results incrementally if needed

### Cost Management
- LLM judges incur API costs
- Use efficient models for evaluation
- Cache results when possible

## Future Enhancements

2. **Comparative evaluation** between different models
3. **Regression testing** with historical baselines
4. **Interactive evaluation** with human feedback
5. **Automated test generation** based on patterns
6. **Integration with CI/CD** pipelines
7. **Real-time monitoring** and alerting
8. **Custom report generation** with visualizations

### Extensibility
