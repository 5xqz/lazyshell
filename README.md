# LazyShell üêö

> A smart CLI tool that generates and executes shell commands using AI

LazyShell is a command-line interface that helps you quickly generate and execute shell commands using AI. It supports multiple AI providers including Google's Gemini and Groq's Llama models.

## Features ‚ú®

- üîç Generates shell commands from natural language descriptions
- ‚ö° Supports multiple AI providers (Google Gemini, Groq)
- üîí Safe execution with confirmation prompt
- üöÄ Fast and lightweight
- üîÑ Automatically detects available AI API keys

## Installation üì¶

### Using npm
```bash
npm install -g lazyshell
```

### Using yarn
```bash
yarn global add lazyshell
```

### Using pnpm (recommended)
```bash
pnpm add -g lazyshell
```

## Prerequisites üîë

You'll need an API key from one of the supported AI providers:

1. **Google Gemini**: Set `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
2. **Groq**: Set `GROQ_API_KEY`

Add your API key to your environment variables or `.env` file:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
# OR
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Tested Models ü§ñ

LazyShell has been tested with the following AI models:

### Google AI Models
- `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` (Default when `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` is set)
  - Fast and efficient model for quick command generation
  - Good balance of speed and accuracy

### Groq Models
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (Default when `GROQ_API_KEY` is set)
  - Powerful open-weight model from Meta
  - Excellent at understanding natural language prompts
  - Provides accurate command suggestions

> Note: The tool will automatically select the appropriate model based on the available API key. Google's Gemini is used by default if both API keys are present.

## Usage üöÄ

### Basic Usage

```bash
